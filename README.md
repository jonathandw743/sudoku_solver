# Soduko Solver

On the `main` branch, a purely logical algorithm is used, which solves a sudoku similarly to a human. This program contains many techniques to solve the more difficult sudokus.

On the `with_backtracking` branch, an algorithm with fewer techniques is used, but backtracking is added which solves the sudoku recursivley. This used the logical techniques for optimisation.
